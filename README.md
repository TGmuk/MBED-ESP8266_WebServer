# ESP8266 Webserver Library

### Library for the STM32 with an ESP8266 Module to use as a weberver

This library is for using a STM32 microcontroller as a webserver

### Configuration
For the configuration, you must copy the [mbed_app.json](mbed_app.json) file to the same directory as the platformio.ini file. 
Note that for strings the string, the string must be contained by `\"` (e.g. `"\"myString\""`).


### Credits
The code was originally written by Jack Hansdampf on mbed for use with Keil Studio (Cloud).

I have just ported it, so that it works with PlatformIO. 
So if there are any bugs, I am not the one who is to blame :^) (You can still tell me and I will try to fix them)
